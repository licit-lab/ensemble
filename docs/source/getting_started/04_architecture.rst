============
Architecture
============

The ENSEMBLE model is a software application containing the specifications from WP2 for deliverables `D2.4.`_.  designed as a Client Line Interface (CLI) application to be executed for a specific scenario and platform. This documentation has as a main objective to provide definitions and a description on the way the design requirements are achieved.


Working principle
-----------------

This application defines the Multibrand Platoon functionality described by the ENSEMBLE project via a set of specifications that are implemented jointly within a python script exchanging information with a traffic simultor. For the use cases 2 traffic simulators have been selected.

Traffic simulators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Platform for simulation of specific traffic scenarios defined for the project.

**Symuvia**
    Open source traffic simulation platform developed and mantained by the `LICIT team <LICITlink>`_ dedicated to integrate multiple models developed within the traffic flow theory community.

**Vissim**
    Traffic simulator  developed by `PVT group <Vissimlink>`_ dedicated to model and simulate scenarios for the ENSEMBLE project. The platform serves mainly as an industrial reference for
    benchmarking the platooning application.
