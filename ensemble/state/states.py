""" 
    This module defines the basic states required to execute and launch a simulation. 

    The states are defined as: 

    * **Compliance**: This state is defined to check availability of files and candidates.
    * **Connect**: This state is defined to process 
    * **Initialize**: This state perform initialization tasks. In example, loading the file scenarios into the simulator. Declaring initial conditions for the platoon, etc. 
    * **Preroutine**: Tasks to be done before the querying information from the simulator
    * **Query**: Tasks of parsing data and querying information from the simulator
    * **Control**: Perform decision tasks for the platoon 
    * **Push**: Push updated information to the simulator for platoon vehicles 
    * **Postroutine**: Performs tasks after the information has been pushed.
