""" 
    This module defines the basic states required to determine the status of a vehicle in a platoon formation

    The states are defined as: 

    * **StandAlone**: Vehicle not in a platoon formation
    * **Joining**: Vehicle willing to join a platoon or willing to create a platoon 
    * **Platooning**: Vehicle inside a platoon formation
    * **Split**: Vehicle is willing to split from current platoon.
