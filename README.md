## Overview

[ENSEMBLE](https://platooningensemble.eu) is an effort to pave the way to multibrand truck platooning. The objective of this repository is to provide a simple way to *launch* and *execute* simulations in different traffic simulation platforms.

This software application describes a model for the platooning driver model which is used within the Eurpean project of [ENSEMBLE](https://platooningensemble.eu).

Here we describe how we think the structure of the cooperation between the specification and the traffic simulation platform is implemented.


## Download

In order to install run in your command line tool:

```{bash}
git clone https://ci.tno.nl/gitlab/paco.hamers-tno/ensemble_drivermodel.git
```
Or obtain direct download [here](https://ci.tno.nl/gitlab/paco.hamers-tno/ensemble_drivermodel/-/archive/master/ensemble_drivermodel-master.zip).


## Install

**Developer environment**

Be sure to obtain `python` and `pip`.  This repository as a standard python package with support for CLI interfacing to improve the interaction.
You can try and test functionalities by installing the package in testing mode.

```
cd ensemble_driver_model
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
pip install --editable .
```
**Note:** Be sure to be in the folder before launching the `pip` instruction

## Use

In order to use this tool, first check the help options via:

```
ensemble --help
```

Which should print the available options

```
‚ùØ ensemble --help
Usage: ensemble [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Scenario launcher for ENSEMBLE simulations

Options:
  --verbose
  --platform TEXT  'symuvia' or 'vissim'
  --help           Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  check   Diagnoses files consistancy and simulator availability
  launch  Launches an escenario for a specific platform
```

Check possible options by typing `ensemble launch` or `ensemble check`. Execute an scenario via

```
ensemble launch -s 'file_scenario.inpx' -s 'file_layout.layx' -l 'C:\my\path\to\vissim'
```
